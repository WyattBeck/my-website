    <p>This website will document my recovery from shoulder surgery. As every person is different and has different
      expectations,
      this is not intended to be a end all document for anyone going through a similar surgery. <br> It started as a
      class project to create
      a website and has evolved as a sort a therapy for myself to look inward on how I am handling a difficult
      situation. <br>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I am a 43 year old father of <a href="#kids-photo">3 beautiful girls</a> and husband to a <a href="#wedding-photo">very beautiful and understanding wife!</a> <br>
        My decision to go back to school after 40 mirrors my reasons that I have to have surgery, I put things off for too long! <br>
        Early in my life I felt like I had to work whatever job I could find to support myself and then my family, <br>
        after that I didn't feel like I had that time to go back to school or deal with small nagging injuries.

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I've always been a fan of video games, and nerd culture.  But recently I've redisocvered my passion for photography.<br>
        The ability to capture moments in time that others would walk past is amazing to me, I hope I can develop my skills to share with more people.

      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to utilize what I learn durning my time at Olympic College to pursue a job that blends web design and photography. <br>
        Because of my health and family commitments my goal I plan on pursuing mostly gig work that allows me to set my own schedule.

    <p>This website will document my recovery from shoulder surgery. <br>

        This is the general timeframe I'm looking at:
       <ol><li>Weeks 0-2 rest and healing, limited mobility and reliance on pain medicaions.</li>
            <li>Weeks 2-4 involve limited movement outside of the sling and doing rehab to increase shoulder stength and mobility.</li>
            <li>Weeks 6-8 more movement allowed without the use of a sling.  Weight restrictions generally removed, rehab as nessesary</li></ol>

    <p>This website will document my recovery from shoulder surgery. As every person is different and has different
      expectations,
      this is not intended to be a end all document for anyone going through a similar surgery. <br> It started as a
      class project to create
      a website and has evolved as a sort a therapy for myself to look inward on how I am handling a difficult
      situation. <br>

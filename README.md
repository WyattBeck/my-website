# 1/26/26 Notes: Added bootstrap for photo carousel.  After working with for awhile I finally was able to get the css to do a bit more of what I wanted to format it.  Will add captions for each image later.  I am also thinking about adding a "Mental Wellness" indicator for each week of recovery that shows how I'm handling both the phyical and mental challanges of recovery and school. Added multiple <h> blocks seperating different parts, possibly use css to help make this look MUCH better.  Added CSS Style for background gradient.
